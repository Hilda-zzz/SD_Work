DEEP LEARNING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the process of working on Starship, I realized I have a serious case of "completion anxiety," which probably stems from a form of perfectionism. During the development of Starship Gold, I was initially very excited and added many features. However, when it came time to wrap up, I found the process excruciating. Even though it seemed like everything was nearly done, my mind was flooded with countless ideas for improvements. Worse still, every new feature triggered even more potential ideas for additional features, and I found myself stuck, unable to continue working because I felt like I couldn’t possibly finish.

So, I shelved the finalization task until now (the end of the semester). When I revisited it, I realized I was actually very close to completion—just about two more hours of work and it could have been submitted. This experience made me realize how crucial it is to set a clear, limited deadline to ensure a project is wrapped up at a reasonable point. It taught me that finishing—no matter how "imperfect"—is more important than obsessing over the details or letting the scope of the project keep expanding.

I’ve also realized that the key to my efficiency lies in the motivation behind my work. When I start a project driven by the excitement of learning new knowledge or experimenting with interesting ideas, I’m highly efficient. I’m energized and focused because the process itself is engaging. However, when I get caught up in peer pressure—whether it's trying to meet others' expectations or comparing myself to my peers—I become anxious, unmotivated, and my productivity drops. The pressure to "perform" for others often makes me lose sight of why I started the project in the first place.

This insight has taught me the importance of staying grounded in the project itself. It’s not about what others think or how fast others are progressing—it’s about what excites me and what I want to learn from the experience.
