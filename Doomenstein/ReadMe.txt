====================How to play===========================
Use the left and right arrow keys to quickly browse through all your weapons and tools. Aim the shovel at plantable terrain to sow seeds. 

After planting, follow the indicator signs next to the field and use the watering to help the plants grow. Finally, harvest with the basket to collect coins. 

(Unfortunately, I haven't implemented any spending mechanics for the coins yet.)
